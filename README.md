## Machine Learning Classification With Hyperparameter Tunning With Streamlit
### Here I have created a website where one can easily do hyperparameter tunning of classification models on some specified dataset and also abale to see there performance without writting any code.
<br>
The app link  is https://ml-classification-sourav.herokuapp.com<br><br>
I have choose:-<br>
1)KNN<br>
2)SVM<br>
3)Random Forest<br>
4)Logistic Regression<br>
5)Gaussian naive bayes<br>
6)Multinomial Naive Bayes<br>
7)Bernoulli's naive bayes<br>
8)Decision Tree<br>

## The dataset I have used<br>
1)Iris<br>
2)Brest Cancer<br>
3)Wine dataset<br>
4)Digit Dataset<br>
5)Diabetes Dataset<br>

All these datasets are available in sklearn.

As the dimension of the dataset are higher then 2D so we can not visualize the data. What I have did here is I reduce the features by using Principal Component Analysis and only keep two features, and then I have make a scatter plot.
